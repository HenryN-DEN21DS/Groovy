= Stress Tests

Tests in this subproject are used for stress testing.  These types of tests
will normally involve calls to `System.gc()`, spinning up many threads, and
may attempt to create OutOfMemory errors.

These tests can be long running and may be prone to failure on different
platforms, so in order to run these tests you must enable them as follows:

    ./gradlew -PstressTests :stress:test

You can run a single test with the following command:

    ./gradlew -PstressTests :stress:test --tests org.codehaus.groovy.util.SomeTest

Or run all tests under in a given package and subpackages:

    ./gradlew -PstressTests :stress:test --tests org.codehaus.*
